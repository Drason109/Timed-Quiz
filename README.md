# Timed-Quiz

The Challenge is to make a Time Quiz website. The website would respond by letting you know if you
got it right or wrong. It will prompt new question to answer if answer correctly. The timer is set for 30 sec and if and answered incorrectly than the timer will decrease. The goal is to answer all the question before times runs out.
